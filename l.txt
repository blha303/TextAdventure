<b>West of Australia</b><br>
You stand in front of a wall a thousand feet high, on a sandy desert plain<br>
with no landmarks around.<br>
You can see the faint outline of a door in the otherwise seamless pure-white<br>
marble but there's no indication that it opens, or indeed has ever opened<br>
before. You wonder what troubles lie ahead.
